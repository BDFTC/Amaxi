The app is made with the goal to provide ambulance services faster 
by registering taxi drivers as the volunteers to help the people 
and do this holy cause.

This app helps in getting fast and cost effective ambulance
services using its advance working mechanism and ML model.


## Flutter

This application is being designed and created on Flutter which
makes it a cross platform application. It has been tested for
android only for now. This application helps the user to book an
ambulance instantly. The app itself finds the nearest driver and 
the nearest hospital and guide the user.
## MapBox

For the guidance of driver to user and then to the hospital, we 
have made use of MapBox.Mapbox is an American provider of custom 
online maps for websites and applications such as Foursquare, 
Lonely Planet, the Financial Times, The Weather Channel, Instacart
Inc. and Snapchat. With the help of MapBox and its APIs, we have
implemented a real time navigation system with voice commands.
