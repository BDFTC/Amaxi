The app is made with the goal to provide ambulance services faster 
by registering taxi drivers as the volunteers to help the people 
and do this holy cause.

This app helps in getting fast and cost effective ambulance
services using its advance working mechanism and ML model.


## Machine Learning
Our Machine Learning model predicts the probability of accident in a certain region and helps us to find the accident prone areas at that very moment. It makes use of various factors such as time, place, day, population and many more. It has one more added functionality in which it also keeps a check of places where the covid patients are rising to be at their help at every time.[under development]
## Flutter

This application is being designed and created on Flutter which
makes it a cross platform application. It has been tested for
android only for now. This application helps the user to book an
ambulance instantly. The app itself finds the nearest driver and 
the nearest hospital and guide the user.
## MapBox

For the guidance of driver to user and then to the hospital, we 
have made use of MapBox. With the help of MapBox and its APIs, we have
implemented a real time navigation system with voice commands.
## Node js (Server)
We used node js to connect back end and front end using a server.
It primarily acted as a bridge between python code and firebase database.
